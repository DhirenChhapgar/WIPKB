Adding Attribute Support to Lot/Serial Number
==================================
Acumatica ERP lets you define attributes for flexible, meaningful classification of an Entity (Lead, Stock/Non-Stock Items Etc.) as required for your company's specific needs. An attribute is a property that enables you to specify additional information for Entity in the system. 

This extension allows to add attribute support to Lot/Serial Number so that each Lot/Serial Number's unique characteristic (such as color variation and stone pattern) can be tracked. With this extension, you can:

* Define attributes to be tracked for each Lot/Serial class
* Specify Attribute values while receiving items via Allocations dialog in Puchase Receipt and Inventory Receipt screens
* Search and allocate Lot/Serial Number by attribute value/s in Sales Order screen.
* Bulk import of attribute values via Import Scenario 

### Prerequisites
* Acumatica 6.1 or higher
